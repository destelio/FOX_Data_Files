As per <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-documentation-in-software-development">Some Answers in Quora...</a>

Documentation is an essential part of the software development process, as it helps to ensure that software applications are well-designed, easy to understand, and maintainable over time. 
Here are a few reasons why documentation is important in software development:

<ol>
<li><b>Communication:</b> Documentation helps to facilitate communication between developers, stakeholders, and end-users. It can help to clarify requirements, explain design decisions, and provide instructions 
  for using the software application.</li>
<li><b>Maintainability:</b> Well-documented software is easier to maintain over time, as developers 
  can understand the codebase and make modifications or improvements more quickly and accurately.</li>

<li><b>Onboarding:</b> Documentation can help new developers to get up to speed quickly on a software project, reducing the time and resources required for onboarding.</li>
<li><b>Compliance:</b> Certain industries or organizations may require documentation as part of regulatory or compliance requirements. 
  Documentation can help to ensure that software applications are developed in accordance with these requirements.</li>
<li><b>Future updates:</b>Documentation can help to ensure that future updates or modifications to the software application are properly planned and executed. This can help to reduce the risk of errors, bugs, or other issues that can arise during updates.
</li>
</ol>

Overall, documentation is an important part of the software development process that can help to ensure that software applications are well-designed, easy to understand, and maintainable over time. While documentation can require additional time and resources during the development process, the benefits of well-documented software can far outweigh the costs.


<h3>Mistake Spotted!</h3>
<p>Here I am just exporting some csv files in order to make them visible to my colleagues.
As it has been noticed, there has been an error, I publish them here so that I can explain the error to my teammates.
Error was spotted in the "area" column and needs to be corrected in all future (web) data extractions from this particular source.
As it has been noted the error is not crucial and the incorrectly extracted data can be easily replacbes as teh correct dat can be found under "title dos" by stripping the first part accordingly.
